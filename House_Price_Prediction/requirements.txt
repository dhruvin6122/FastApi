# 🏠 House Price Prediction — Full Stack Machine Learning App

A complete **end-to-end Machine Learning project** built with **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **Scikit-Learn**.  
The application predicts **house prices** based on input features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking availability.

This project demonstrates the full ML workflow — **data creation → model training → REST API → frontend UI**.
